//  This is the network request manager singleton class. I use AFNetworking for the Network connection, using cocoapods.
//  pods are in the box therefore it should run the application withoud any problem. Because of the currency descriptions are remain same in the life cycly of the app, I cached it after the first fatch so that we can reduce the network cost.
